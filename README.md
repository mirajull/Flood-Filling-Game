Flood It Game

By Muhammad Alahmadi and Md Mirajul Islam

To run the code, you have to install 'termcolor' library.  
To play the game in an interactive setting please run the board.py file  
To run the experiments please run the player.py file while setting the variable simulations = True and you can set the following parameters inside the code: 'numberOfBoards', 'boardSize' and 'numberOfColors'.  
If you set the variable 'oneTime' = True, then the code will run the algorithm specified in variable 'algorithm' on the board with printing the steps for every move. This is not applicable to UCS Algorithm.  
The code is tested and running good in VScode and Pycharm with python 3.10
The code is partially based on the repo: https://github.com/LeanMilk/Flood-It
